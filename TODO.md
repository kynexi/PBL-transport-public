To Do:

If you have any questions, feel free to ask me.

Input and Building the Graph:

- [ ] Create a list of streets and connections between them

You can use openstreetamp and osmnx (python library)

- [ ] Create the directed graph that represents the street network

- [ ] Assign travel demand values to nodes (or edges)

Here we need to identify high-demand destinations (universities, malls, city centers)

Population density can be used as a demand value coefficient

Alternatively use the idea of schedule (the more often a bus crosses a station, the higher demand it is) (This might take a long time)

Building the Algorithm:

I'm currently thinking that we could use a few different algorithms and then compare all of them.

Currently thinking that we should try:

Yen's algorithm (builds on dijkstra's)

Search algorithm (described in solution.md)

- [ ] Build Yen's

- [ ] Build Search
